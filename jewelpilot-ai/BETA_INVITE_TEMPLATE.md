# Beta Invite Template

Hey! I just opened beta access for **LustrePilot AI**.

It helps generate high-converting jewelry listings for:
- Etsy
- Amazon
- Shopify (including HTML descriptions)

If you’re up for testing, I’d love your feedback.

What I need from you:
1) Try 2-3 real products
2) Tell me where it feels confusing or slow
3) Share which outputs you’d actually publish

In return, I’ll prioritize your requested fixes/features.

Reply “I’m in” and I’ll share access + quick onboarding.
